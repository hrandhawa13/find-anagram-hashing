# find anagram hashing
it takes input from file and outputs anagram into a different file. 
It takes 3 files input, output, dictionary. 
The program searches for the anagrams of words from input file in dictionary (more than 25000 words) 
 I used hashing to store the words of dictionary file into two 2d vectors. 
 Time complexity for finding an anagram is O(1). 
 It was a school project and i got the best design award for this.
 Hope it helps someone :).
