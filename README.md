# find anagram hashing
it takes input from file and outputs anagram into a different file. It takes 3 files input, output, dictionary. the program searches for the anagrams of words from input file.
 I used hashing to store the words of dictionary file into 2 2d vectors. 
 Time complexity for finding an anagram is O(1). 
 it was a school project and i got the best design award for this.
 Hope it helps someone :).
